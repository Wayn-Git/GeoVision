# GeoVision

Satellite change detection powered by Google Earth Engine, Dynamic World land cover classification, and AI driven natural language explanations.

## Overview

Existing land-cover products often expose raw classifications but don't help users ask natural language questions or understand changes. GeoVision combines satellite imagery, land-cover analysis, and AI explanations into an interactive system for exploring environmental change.

GeoVision is a web application that analyzes satellite imagery to detect land cover changes over time. It leverages Sentinel 2 multispectral data and Dynamic World probability maps to identify transitions between land cover classes such as forest, urban, water, agriculture, and bare land. The system features an AI chat interface that lets users ask questions about land use changes in natural language, with real time streaming updates and detailed AI generated explanations.

## Architecture

The application follows a modular pipeline architecture:

```
Geocode Location
       |
       v
Resolve AOI (GAUL District / OSM City)
       |
       v
Fetch Sentinel 2 Composite (Before)
       |
       v
Fetch Sentinel 2 Composite (After)
       |
       v
Build Dynamic World Probability Maps (Before + After)
       |
       v
Detect Changes (Rule Engine + Spectral Cross Validation)
       |
       v
Compute Land Cover Statistics
       |
       v
Generate AI Explanation (Groq LLM)
```

### Pipeline Steps

1. **Geocoding**: Resolves user provided location strings to lat/lon coordinates via Nominatim.
2. **AOI Resolution**: Looks up the corresponding FAO GAUL Level 2 district boundary, or uses OSM to find a city/town polygon.
3. **Composite Building**: Fetches Sentinel 2 SR Harmonized scenes, applies cloud filtering and SCL masking, then computes a median composite for each time period.
4. **Dynamic World Processing**: Medians Dynamic World probability bands to create stable per pixel class distributions.
5. **Signature Mapping**: Maps 9 band DW probabilities into a 5 class schema (Water, Forest, Bare Land, Agriculture, Urban) with dominance margins and confidence floors.
6. **Change Detection**: Applies a three gate rule engine per approved transition:
   * Confidence gate: both endpoints must exceed minimum class proportion
   * Surge gate: target class probability must increase significantly
   * Spectral gate: NDVI/NDWI cross validation to reject false positives
7. **Statistics**: Computes per class pixel counts and percentages using GEE reduceRegion.
8. **Explanation**: Formats results and land cover stats into a prompt for the Groq LLM to generate natural language insights.

## Change Detection Methodology

GeoVision uses a rigorous multi gate approach to minimize false positives:

### Approved Transitions

The system monitors these specific land cover transitions:

| From | To | Label | Color |
|------|-----|-------|-------|
| Forest | Urban | Forest to Urban | #f44336 |
| Water | Urban | Water to Urban | #1976d2 |
| Forest | Water | Forest to Water | #81c784 |
| Urban | Forest | Urban to Forest | #009688 |
| Urban | Water | Urban to Water | #00bcd4 |
| Water | Forest | Water to Forest | #1e88e5 |

### Three Gate Validation

For a pixel to register as a valid transition, it must pass all three gates:

1. **Confidence Gate**: Both the source and target class proportions must exceed `MIN_CLASS_CONF` (0.45) in their respective timelines. This ensures both endpoints are decisive classifications rather than noisy mixed pixels.

2. **Surge Gate**: The target class's raw Dynamic World probability must have increased by at least `MIN_PROB_SURGE` (0.25) between the before and after periods. This catches genuine transitions rather than classification noise at the boundary.

3. **Spectral Gate**: Independent spectral indices cross validate the Dynamic World labels. Transitions to forest require NDVI >= 0.3, and transitions to water require NDWI >= 0.1. This rejects shadows misclassified as water and senescent vegetation misclassified as bare land.

### Signature Mapping

Dynamic World provides 9 probability bands per pixel. GeoVision maps these to a simplified 5 class schema using raw (non normalized) probabilities with a dominance margin check. A class is only assigned if it beats every other class by at least 0.05 and has a raw proportion of at least 0.25. This prevents "tallest dwarf" errors where all classes have low confidence but one happens to be highest.


## Land Cover Classes

| Class | Color | Code |
|-------|-------|------|
| Water | Deep Blue | 0 |
| Forest | Green | 1 |
| Bare Land | Brown | 3 |
| Agriculture | Yellow | 4 |
| Urban | Red | 6 |


## AI Chat Features

The chat interface supports natural language queries such as:

* "What changed in Mumbai between 2020 and 2024?"
* "Show me deforestation in Amazon 2019 to 2023"
* "Analyze urban growth in Bangalore from 2018 to 2024"
* "How has the coastline changed in Dubai since 2017?"

The chat parser maintains conversation history, reuses previously established parameters, and asks clarifying questions when location or dates are missing. It also supports city level granularity when users specify sub areas (e.g., "Kharadi, Pune" or "Whitefield, Bangalore").
